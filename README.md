Data over feeding, sleeping and other habits of a baby.

## Data
Automated data from Baby tracker and created data from Wonder weeks.

### tove.ipynb
Initial look at the Baby tracker data and creating a csv with daily aggregated data.

### data_wonderweek.ipynb
Combinding the daily data from Baby tracker and the Wonder week data. Looking for correlation and other similar patterns. 

### estimate.ipynb
Can we estimate the babys habit pattern in a good way?
It seem so far like we with this data can't do that with a good quality.
Linear Regression tested. Random Foreste Regressor to be tested. 

## Analysis
Mostly trying to find correlation and patterns in the data.
Also going to see if you can estimate future baby habits using ML.
