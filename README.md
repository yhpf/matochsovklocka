Data over feeding, sleeping and other habits of a baby.

## Data
Automated data from Baby tracker and created data from Wonder weeks.

### tove.ipynb
Initial look at the Baby tracker data and creating a csv with daily aggregated data.

### data_wonderweek.ipynb
Combinding the daily data from Baby tracker and the Wonder week data. Looking for correlation and other similar patterns. 

### estimate.ipynb
Can we estimate the babys habit pattern in a good way?
Linear Regression tested and Random Foreste Regressor tested. 

## Analysis
Mostly trying to find correlation and patterns in the data.
Also going to see if you can estimate future baby habits using ML.

## Conclusion 
The data can be used to look at specific days and statistical measurements. However it is not suitable to use to estimate a specific behavior for the baby. There are to little data and also the data input is solemnly based on the app users choices. At some points there might not have been feeding or diaper change bc it was not possible or it might have been done bc it was a convinient time. So it's not only based on the need of the baby. This makes the data highly subjective.
